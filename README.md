# Random Movie Picker

A small program I made entirely with ChatGPT. It picks a random movie from a list you export from IMDb and load into the program (I included my own watchlist in the release file as an example).

You can also apply filters before picking a movie. And if you add your OMDB API key, the app will show the movieâ€™s poster and plot too.

I built this because every time I want to watch something, I get overwhelmed by too many choices and end up watching nothing. This just gives you one random movie and I think that makes it way more helpful.
