# Random Movie Picker

A small program I made entirely with ChatGPT. It picks a random movie from a list you export from IMDb and load from inside the program(I put my watchlist in the release file as an example list). Additionly, you can apply filters before picking a movie and If you put OMDB api key, you also get the poster and plot of the movie.

I built this because every time I want to watch something, I get overwhelmed by too many options and end up watching nothing. This gives you just one random movie and I think it will be more helpfull.
